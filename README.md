## Context
### Motivation
There are many apps out there already to track your cycling.  However, most are heavy/try to do too much with complicated user interfaces.  terraGO is super simple from the login to the one click start and 0 minute learning curve.  terraGO is beautiful in its simplicity.

I am a biking enthusiast and found the current app choices were all to one size fits all types.  

I picked React-Native so the app would be available to both iOS and Android from a single code base, making it easier to scale and maintain.

### Personas
I envision people that enjoy competitive biking but also want to keep the experience simple and frustration free using terraGO.  It solves the problem of being able to track ride and stats without having to waste time learning to use the app.
